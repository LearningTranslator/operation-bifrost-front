## About Operation Bifrost

Operation Bifrost is a fan translation project focused on localizing the Steins;Gate visual novel into Thai. Our mission is to break language barriers for Thai fans of the Science Adventure series by providing a high-quality translation of this beloved game.

### Project Overview

Steins;Gate is a visual novel game developed by MAGES & Nitroplus, part of the Science Adventure Series. While the game has a large fanbase in Thailand, there is no official Thai translation available. Operation Bifrost aims to fill this gap by creating a comprehensive fan translation patch.
